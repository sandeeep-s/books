# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems
Creating systems that are **reliable**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** often involves balancing trade-offs. This guide covers key priorities and essential concepts for building and operating such systems.
## Core Building Blocks
The following foundational components are essential for building robust systems:
1. **Databases**: Store and query persistent data for transactions or analytics.
2. **Caches**: Accelerate access to frequently used or expensive-to-compute data.
3. **Search Indexes**: Support fast and efficient search and filtering.
4. **Stream Processing**: React to or analyze asynchronous event streams in real-time.
5. **Batch Processing**: Perform periodic, large-scale computations (typically for analytics).

## Combining and Integrating Tools
Modern systems combine tools to meet diverse functional and operational use cases. Selecting and integrating tools depends on:
- Technical complexity.
- Legacy code and infrastructure.
- Time to market.
- Risk tolerance and compliance needs.

## Key Priorities for System Design
### 1. Reliability
_Reliability ensures that a system continues to function correctly in the face of faults._
#### **Fault vs Failure**
- A **fault** occurs when a component misbehaves (e.g., server crash, software bug).
- A **failure** occurs when the system as a whole is unable to fulfill its purpose.

#### **Types of Faults and Mitigations**
1. **Hardware Faults**:
    - Failures caused by hard drive crashes, network errors, etc.
    - **Mitigation**: Redundancy (e.g., RAID, failover systems), replication, and backups.

2. **Software Errors**:
    - Bugs, memory leaks, or crashes in software components.
    - **Mitigation**: Testing, isolation of services, monitoring, and recovery mechanisms (e.g., idempotent requests, crash recovery).

3. **Human Errors**:
    - Accidental misconfigurations or deployments.
    - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, rollback mechanisms, controlled experiments (e.g., canary deployments), and automation.

### 2. Scalability
_Scalability is the ability of the system to handle increasing load efficiently._
#### **Load Metrics**
- **Requests per second (RPS):** Measures system throughput.
- **Concurrent users**: Real-time usage levels.
- **Read/write ratios**: Critical to database scaling.

#### **Performance Metrics**
1. **Service Time**:
    - Time taken by the system to process a request (excluding network or queuing delays).

2. **Response Time**:
    - Total time to fulfill a request (includes **service time**, queuing delays, and network latency).

3. **Tail Latencies**:
    - High-percentile response times (e.g., p95, p99). These are key for user experience and often influence design decisions.

#### **Common Scalability Issues**
1. **Head-of-Line (HOL) Blocking**:
    - **Problem**: Slow tasks at the front of a queue block subsequent tasks (e.g., in networking, thread pools).
    - **Mitigation**: Shorter queues, parallel processing where possible, and prioritization strategies.

2. **Tail Latency Amplification**:
    - **Problem**: In distributed systems, the slowest subsystem component causes delays for the entire system.
    - **Mitigation**: Redundancy, retries with bounded timeouts, load balancing, or graceful degradation of non-critical functionality.

#### **Scaling Approaches**
1. **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**:
    - Use bigger machines with more computing power.
    - **Advantages**: Simpler to implement.
    - **Disadvantages**: Finite scalability and expensive resource constraints.

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**:
    - Add additional machines to share the load.
    - **Advantages**: Infinite scalability in theory.
    - **Disadvantages**: Increased complexity (e.g., distributed data and coordination challenges).

#### **Elastic vs Fixed Scaling**
1. **Elastic Scaling**:
    - Dynamically adjusts resources based on load. Common in cloud computing.
    - **Advantage**: Efficient and cost-effective under variable load.

2. **Manual (Fixed) Scaling**:
    - Predetermined resources are allocated in advance.
    - **Advantage**: Simpler with predictable cost and behavior.

### 3. Maintainability
_Maintainability ensures the system is easy to operate, debug, and evolve over time._
#### **Key Principles**
1. **Operability**:
    - Invest in tools and practices for monitoring, alerting, logging, and automation to detect and fix issues proactively.
    - Ensure proper observability through metrics and tracing.

2. **Simplicity**:
    - Avoid unnecessary complexity by designing modular and well-documented systems.
    - Favor simple, well-understood components that are easy to test and debug.

3. **Evolvability**:
    - Systems must adapt to new functionality, scale, or regulations without requiring major overhauls.
    - Encourage modular architecture and refactoring for long-term flexibility.

## Trade-Offs and Design Choices
- No system can maximize **scalability**, **reliability**, and **maintainability** simultaneously. Engineers must make trade-offs based on application requirements, expected growth, team capacity, and business goals.
- For example, prioritizing simplicity can improve maintainability but may limit advanced performance optimizations.

## Key Takeaways
1. Build reliability by mitigating faults, isolating failures, and using redundancy.
2. Scale systems by addressing bottlenecks, carefully managing performance metrics, and considering horizontal/elastic scaling.
3. Maintain systems by ensuring operability, minimizing complexity, and designing for evolution.
4. Make trade-offs based on your systemâ€™s unique constraints and requirements.
